**Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Project**
9
​
10
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
11
* Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)
12
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
13
* Design, train and test a model architecture
14
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
15
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
16
* Summarize the results with a written report
17

## Rubric Points
25
### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Data Set Summary & Exploration
37
​
38
#### 1. Basic summary of the data set.
39
I used the numpy library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic signs data set:
40
​
41
* The size of training set = 34799
42
* The size of the validation set = 4410
43
* The size of test set is = 12630
44
* The shape of a traffic sign image = (32, 32, 3)
45
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set = 43
46

#### 2. An exploratory visualization of the dataset.
